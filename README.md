How it works:
We're going to write a very basic web app using the Flask framework in python with a few buttons that will control our arduino through a serial interface with python. What does this mean? It means that when we send a request to our webpage, our web server (aka our computer) will then send a message to our arduino via the serial port/USB port on our computer, our arduino device will interpret that message and perform said task.

Step 2: Setting Up Pyduino + Checking Circuit

Step 3: Creating the Webserver With Python

Step 4: Integrating Pyduino With Flask

Step 5: Controlling Your Arduino With Your Mobile Device!

Step 6: Creating a Basic Web Api With Python
